A collection of scripts designed to secure/harden macos software

## Repository Notes
This repository is still a work in progress. While this repository does have some scripts that can help secure macOS, they do nowhere near enough to secure the system as well as it should be. So while you can use the scripts to help secure your mac, please look into other sources that can help you more.
*More scripts will be added in the future.*
