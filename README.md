# macOS Security Scripts
A collection of scripts designed to secure/harden macos software

## Repository Notes
This repository is still a work in progress. While it does have some scripts that can help secure macOS, they do nowhere near enough to secure the system as much as it should. So while you can use these scripts to help secure your mac, please look for other resources that can help secure your computer even more.
*More scripts will be added in the future.*
